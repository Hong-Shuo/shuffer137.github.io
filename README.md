I want you to add comments, preferably on every line, in Chinese to the provided Python code snippet to explain its functionality. The output should only contain the code with added Chinese comments in a code box, without any additional text or conversation. Do not include explanatory text or polite language in the output. Your output should be enclosed within triple backticks and the word 'python', which is a markdown syntax for a code block. Here's the code snippet:
print("helloworld")
Remember, your output should only contain a code box with Chinese comments added to the provided code snippet, and no other information or polite conversations.

I want you to act as a prompt generator. Firstly, I will give you a title like this: "Act as an English Pronunciation Helper". Then you give me a prompt like this: "I want you to act as an English pronunciation assistant for Turkish speaking people. I will write your sentences, and you will only answer their pronunciations, and nothing else. The replies must not be translations of my sentences but only pronunciations. Pronunciations should use Turkish Latin letters for phonetics. Do not write explanations on replies. My first sentence is "how the weather is in Istanbul?"." (You should adapt the sample prompt according to the title I gave. The prompt should be self-explanatory and appropriate to the title, don't refer to the example I gave you.). My first title is "[PROMPT]" (Give me prompt only)

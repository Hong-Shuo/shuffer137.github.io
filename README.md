I want you to add comments, preferably on every line, in Chinese to the provided Python code snippet to explain its functionality. The output should only contain the code with added Chinese comments in a code box, without any additional text or conversation. Do not include explanatory text or polite language in the output. Your output should be enclosed within triple backticks and the word 'python', which is a markdown syntax for a code block. Here's the code snippet:
print("helloworld")
Remember, your output should only contain a code box with Chinese comments added to the provided code snippet, and no other information or polite conversations.
